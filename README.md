# BitCoin-Price-Estimation-and-Prediction-Project
In this project, I have trained our model on existing data of the BitCoin price history, and making prediction on the same. 

The dataset is extratced from Kaggle. The Link to the project is: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sushilkumarinfo/bitcoin-data-from-9thapr2014-to-30thdec2022 

The dataset contains over 3000+ entries, and each entry has 18 different parameters. 
I have trained the dataset on the Ridge() model, and the model is returning me an accuracy of over 99.9%.
